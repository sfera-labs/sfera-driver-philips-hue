		This driver implements the integration with the Philips Hue wireless bulbs through their bridge device connected to the local network.
		<p>
		<h3>Setup</h3>
		The first time the driver connects to the Hue bridge, an authentication procedure is required.
		<p>
		Configure the driver and let it start. After few seconds an event with ID 'authentication' and value 'true' will trigger. 
		At this point you have 30 seconds to manually press the button on the Hue bridge. From now on, the driver is authenticated and this procedure will be no longer needed.
		<p>
		N.B. the authentication is linked to the ID assigned to the Hue driver instance. Changing the ID will require performing the authentication procedure again.
